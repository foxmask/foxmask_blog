> Thankfulness is the key to happiness  

Sometimes you never received a thanks for a project you made for a friend, sometimes you [received a thanks](https://github.com/foxmask/wallabag_api/issues/1) from unknown people who just had fun with a little piece of code.

Open Source is like that ;)

And then, recently I crossed the road of a funny project ["Say thanks"](https://saythanks.io/). Which permits to drop a little word to the author of the project you enjoyed.
This project looks as clear and clean, as we usually see projects by [Kenneth Reitz,](https://github.com/kennethreitz/) ["Mister Requests"](https://python-requests.org). The strength is the simplicity. (I am asking myself if he does not play chess too, where strength in simplicity is often met:). I noticed a detail about the [README of his project](https://github.com/kennethreitz/saythanks.io/blob/master/README.md) "Random inspiration Links" ;)

Then, if you have enjoyed [Trigger Happy](https://trigger-happy.eu), just drop me a word from [![Say thanks to](https://img.shields.io/badge/SayThanks.io-%E2%98%BC-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/foxmask)
