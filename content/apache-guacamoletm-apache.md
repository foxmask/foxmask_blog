# Apache Guacamole™ - apache

[Apache Guacamole™ - apache](https://guacamole.apache.org/)


Apache Guacamole is a **clientless remote desktop gateway**. It supports
standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.

We call it clientless because no plugins or client software are
required.

Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need
to access your desktops is a web browser.
