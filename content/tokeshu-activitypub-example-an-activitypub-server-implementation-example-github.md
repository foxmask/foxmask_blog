[](#activitypub-example-server) ActivityPub example server 
===========================================================================================================

This is an example server implementing a few basic features of
[activitypub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

Because ActivityPub is quite generic, the goal here is not to implement
every aspect of ActivityPub but just a coherent subset that can be used
for understanding the protocol as well as for testing. Thus the use case
is microblogging: users can only publish or like notes and follow each
others.
