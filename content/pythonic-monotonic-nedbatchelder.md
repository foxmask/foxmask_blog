# Pythonic monotonic - nedbatchelder

In a recent conversation, someone shared some code from a book about
technical job interviews. They wanted to know if I agreed that the code
was &#34;Pythonic.&#34;

a list, and to produce a sequence of the runs, but to reverse the
decreasing runs, so that they are also increasing. This was the
&#34;Python...
