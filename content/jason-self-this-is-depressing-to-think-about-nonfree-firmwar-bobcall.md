[Jason Self: &#34;This is depressing to think about nonfree firmwar…&#34; - bobcall](https://social.bobcall.me/@jxself/107752668551030433)

&lt;div&gt;

This is depressing to think about nonfree firmware eating the world:

Uncompressed source code of Linux 5.16.7: 1.1GB

The \&#34;source\&#34; of nonfree firmware: Over 700MB and growing so it\&#39;s a
good percentage of the size of the ENTIRE KERNEL ITSELF.

Free firmware with actual source code? 24.5MB and not growing

&lt;/div&gt;
